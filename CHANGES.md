v 1.0.0 
 
 * Refactored the code to follow a standard that fits author better.  
 * Removed the `depth` property and introduced a `setObjectMaxDepth` method to use instead.  
 * `get(tag: string)` no longer returns the full tag object when called, tag is now required.  
 * Replaced setcolor method with setColor (spelling fix).
